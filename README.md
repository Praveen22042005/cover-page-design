			<h3>An Excerpt from Chapter One</h3>

			<p>Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.</p>

			<p> And then, thought Clarissa Dalloway, what a morning--fresh as if issued to children on a beach.</p>

			<p> He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished--how strange it was!--a few sayings like this about cabbages.</p>

			<p>There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.</p>

			<p>. In people's eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.</p>

			<p> But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh--the admirable Hugh!</p>

			<p>"Good-morning to you, Clarissa!" said Hugh, rather extravagantly, for they had known each other as children. "Where are you off to?"</p>

			<p>"I love walking in London," said Mrs. Dalloway. "Really it's better than walking in the country."</p>
